# ðŸ’» Nextra Blog: Memory Comparison

This is a small research project for a **hardware subject** in my course written in portuguese.  
Instead of submitting a traditional Word documents, I decided to be more creative and build a mini blog site using [**Nextra**](https://nextra.site).

## ðŸ§  Topic  
**Comparing pc components** 

The project includes real product examples, performance comparisons, use cases, and practical recommendations.

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack  
- [Nextra](https://nextra.site) (theme: `nextra-theme-blog`)
- Markdown + MDX

## ðŸ“‚ Purpose  
This project was made to:
- Practice using modern documentation tools
- Present technical research in a cleaner and more interactive format
- Explore the capabilities of Nextra and MDX for future uses
